first row:
	type of case: RAMP
	number of following lines to read
	edit step size (if 0, there will be no edits at regular intervals. Time-knots are also read from time_knots.in)
	neutron eq solution option
	precursor eq solution option
	time step size - use 0 for adaptive time steps, otherwise a constant time step will be used
	eps_TOL
	eps_n_eos
	omega convergence option
	convergence pararameter choice
second row:
	rho(0)
	time multiplier a ( rho(t) = rho(0) + a*t )
	last time step: must be divisible by the time step
